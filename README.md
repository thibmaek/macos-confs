# üçé macOS Confs ‚Äî Collective repository macOS configuration & bootstrapping
This repository is aimed at collecting some handy/useful/lengthy/hard scripts and configurations for macOS machines.
It's the first thing I clone to a new MacBook and then it's basically just a pick & mix of scripts and configurations to install. No install.sh or installation method, only manual cp & running scripts allowed üôåüèª

# What's in the box?
Lots of stuff!

- Some [install scripts](./installers) to set up common packages & binaries
- [Configuration files](./configs) for popular tools & applications
- [Utilities](./utils) for bash scripting

# Installation?
It's a pick & mix! You can manually copy over files with cp, rsync, drag and drop or choose to copy over the whole folder like `cp -R installers/**/* $HOME/.installers/`. This is in no way a provisioning tool, then you're better off with Puppet, Ansible, etc. Running headless or automated not recommended since these scripts might require interaction.

# Testing?
Runs test.sh for shellcheck'ing the files on Travis CI or locally in dev with `bash test.sh`
